I am an image scientist and a [street-photographer][portfolio]. Currently, I work at the Camera Technologies group at [Apple][apple]. Combining my drive for technical innovation with photography, I work on the next-generation computational cameras that enable both machine-vision-driven and photographic experiences. My  expertise spans optical design, computer vision, and machine learning to achieve such frameworks with high-throughput so that they are used in the design and architecture new products.

In another life, I was an academic and worked as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute][iins] of the [University of Amsterdam][uva] (UvA). Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow in the [Computational Imaging Lab][cilab] at [UC Berkeley]. During my time in Berkeley, I was co-affiliated with the
[Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory] [bair] and [Berkeley
Center for Computational Imaging] [bcci]. I obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at [EPFL] in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
