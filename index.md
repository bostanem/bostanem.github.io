I have joined the [University of Amsterdam][uva] (UvA) as an Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute][iins]. My website is currently under construction. 

---

Before joining UvA, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the [Computational Imaging Lab][cilab] at [UC
Berkeley] sponsored by [Laura Waller][laura]. I was also affiliated with the
[Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory] [bair] and [Berkeley
Center for Computational Imaging] [bcci] during my time in Berkeley. I have obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at [EPFL] advised by [Michael Unser][michael]. 

In broad terms, my research combines optical physics, computer vision, and machine learning to co-design hardware and computation elements of next-generation systems for acquiring, reconstructing, analyzing, understanding, and displaying high-dimensional visual data. 

You can check  my publications [here][scholar] and my CV can be found [here][resume].
