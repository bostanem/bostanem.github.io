I'm a graduate student in computer science at [UC Berkeley], advised
by [Prof. Ras Bodik][bodik] and [Prof. Nir Yosef][yosef]. I'm interested in program synthesis and its
applications to systems biology.

I have completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees at [EPFL], where my advisor was
[Prof. Viktor Kuncak][kuncak].

My CV can be found [here][CV].
