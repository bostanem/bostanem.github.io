I am a research scientist at [ams AG International][ams]. I work on the design of next-generation 3D imaging/sensing systems. My expertise combines optical physics, computer vision, and machine learning to achieve seamless integration of hardware and software elements for acquiring, reconstructing, and understanding 3D scenes.

Before joining ams in 2020, I was an Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute][iins] of the [University of Amsterdam][uva] (UvA). Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the [Computational Imaging Lab][cilab] at [UC Berkeley]. I was also affiliated with the
[Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory] [bair] and [Berkeley
Center for Computational Imaging] [bcci] during my time in Berkeley. I have obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at [EPFL].
