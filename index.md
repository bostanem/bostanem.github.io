I am an image scientist at [Apple][apple] and a street [non-photographer][portfolio], allowing me to combine my vision for technical innovation with my passion for photography. As a member of the Camera Technologies Group at Apple, I work on the next-generation cameras that unlock new applications in machine-vision, mobile photography, and spatial computing. To enable the design and architecture of new camera systems with high-throughput, my technical expertise combines optical imaging, computer vision, and machine learning. 

In another life, I was an academic and worked as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute][iins] of the [University of Amsterdam][uva]. Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow in the [Computational Imaging Lab][cilab] at [UC Berkeley]. During my time in Berkeley, I was co-affiliated with the
[Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory] [bair] and [Berkeley
Center for Computational Imaging] [bcci]. I obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at [EPFL] in 2011 and 2016, respectively. As a souvenir of this era, I keep my [scholar][scholar] page.
