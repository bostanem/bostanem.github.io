I'm a post-doctoral researcher in the [Computational Imaging Lab][cilab] at [UC
Berkeley] sponsored by [Laura Waller][laura]. I'm also affiliated with the
[Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory] [bair] and [Berkeley
Center for Computational Imaging] [bcci].


In broad terms, my research interests are at the intersection of signal
processing, optical physics, and computer science, with applications in
bioimaging and physical sciences. I'm particularly interested in image
reconstruction algorithms, compressive imaging,  non-linear and non-convex
optimization, machine learning theory, and statistical inference. 


I have obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at [EPFL] advised by [Michael
Unser][michael]. 

You can check  my publications [here][scholar] and my CV can be found [here][resume].
